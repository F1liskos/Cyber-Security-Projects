### macOS Keylogger: A Stealthy Input Monitoring Tool

**Overview:**\
This macOS keylogger is a custom-built software tool designed to monitor and log keystrokes on a macOS system. It operates discreetly in the background, capturing all keyboard input and saving it to a secure log file. The keylogger is intended for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring your own devices, parental control, or employee activity with proper consent.

**Key Features:**

1.  **Stealth Operation:** Runs in the background without any visible interface, ensuring it remains undetected by the user.

2.  **Keystroke Logging:** Captures all keystrokes, including special keys (e.g., Shift, Ctrl, Command) and writes them to a log file.

3.  **File Storage:** Logs are saved to a specified file location, which can be encrypted for added security.

4.  **Timestamping:** Each keystroke is recorded with a timestamp, providing a chronological record of user activity.

5.  **Customizable:** Configurable options for log file location, encryption, and activation/deactivation.

6.  **Low Resource Usage:** Optimized to minimize CPU and memory usage, ensuring it doesn't impact system performance.

**Technical Details:**

-   **Language:** Written in [Programming Language, Python].

-   **APIs Used:** Utilizes macOS APIs such as Core Graphics and IOKit for capturing keyboard events.

-   **Compatibility:** Designed for macOS [version, e.g., macOS Big Sur and later].

-   **Permissions:** Requires accessibility permissions to monitor system-wide keyboard input.

**Use Cases:**

-   **Personal Monitoring:** Track your own activity for productivity analysis.

-   **Parental Control:** Monitor children's computer usage to ensure safe browsing.

-   **Employee Monitoring:** With proper consent, track employee activity on company-owned devices.

-   **Security Research:** Study user behavior and input patterns for research purposes.

**Disclaimer:**\
This keylogger is intended for ethical and legal use only. Unauthorized use of this software to monitor individuals without their consent is illegal and unethical. Always ensure compliance with local laws and regulations before deploying this tool.

**Installation:**

1.  Clone the repository or download the source code.

2.  Build the project using [build tool, e.g., Xcode, Makefile].

3.  Grant necessary permissions in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility.

4.  Configure the settings (e.g., log file location) as needed.

5.  Run the keylogger.

**Future Enhancements:**

-   Add remote logging capabilities (with proper security measures).

-   Implement advanced filtering to capture specific keywords or applications.

-   Enhance encryption for log files to ensure data security.
