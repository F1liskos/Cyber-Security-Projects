# Overview

An internal security audit assessment done on Botium Toys, a fictitious toy company, completed as part of my cybersecurity portfolio and as part of Google's [Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate) on Coursera in the  [Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/manage-security-risks?specialization=cybersecurity-certificate).

The goal is to perform an audit of Botium Toys’ cybersecurity program. The audit needs to align current business practices with industry standards and best practices. It is meant to provide mitigation recommendations for vulnerabilities classified as “high risk” and present an overall strategy for improving the organization's security posture. The audit team must document their findings, provide remediation plans and efforts, and communicate with stakeholders.

# Scenario

This scenario is based on a fictional company:

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide.

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.

## The objectives of Botium Toys’ internal IT audit are to:

1\. Adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF).

2\. Establish improved processes to ensure system compliance.

3\. Strengthen system controls.

4\. Implement the principle of least privilege in user credential management.

5\. Develop comprehensive policies and procedures, including playbooks.

# Compliance Checklist

To review compliance regulations and standards, read the [controls, frameworks, and compliance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-cybersecurity/supplement/xu4pr/controls-frameworks-and-compliance) documents.

- Botium Toys must follow the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. citizens' data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. Additionally, if a breach occurs and an E.U. citizen's data is compromised, they must be informed within 72 hours of the incident.

- Botium Toys must follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

PCI DSS is an international security standard that ensures organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment.

- Botium Toys must follow the System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2) The SOC1 and SOC2 are reports focusing on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels. They are used to assess an organization's financial compliance and risk levels. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

One challenge I faced was finding the right balance between detail and clarity in my stakeholder report. At first, I found it tough to keep my findings concise without overwhelming anyone with too much info. This process really taught me about structuring my thoughts better—like using bullet points, avoiding repetition, and sticking to the main points. It was a great reminder to prioritize clear and brief communication in a professional setting. I also had to put in extra effort to connect the System and Organizations Controls (SOC) standard with broader organizational policies and risks. While I got its value for financial compliance, making its impact clear on aspects like user access, data integrity, and confidentiality took some work. This experience helped me appreciate how compliance, security, and operational policies are all intertwined.

## Key Takeaways

This assignment really reinforced how important it is to communicate clearly and tailor my technical knowledge for different audiences. It made me realize that security isn’t just about compliance; it’s about understanding the wider impact on an organization’s operations and overall risk posture. Moving forward, I’m eager to keep refining how I present complex ideas in a more straightforward and actionable way. If anyone has suggestions or other areas for me to explore to make this audit even better, I’m all ears! Overall, it was a rewarding experience, and I can’t wait to apply what I learned in future projects.
